This is a companion article to the one on [Google Play Screenshots](https://github.com/HotpotDesign/Google-Play-Screenshots).

The goal with these posts is to help developers understand the requirements and best practices for marketing apps on the App Store and Google Play.

## Examples

## Overview
Feature graphics are not required for publishing apps on Google Play. However, they are highly recommended because feature graphics are required for featured placement. Moreover, the feature graphic is an opportunity to attract new users and entice them to download your app by highlighting key benefits and pain points. From the Android Google Play guide:

> The feature graphic is the first thing your potential users see when they open your app’s store listing. On the majority of Android smartphones and tablets, it occupies a third of the screen. As a result, it can have a significant impact on a store visitor’s decision to download your app and is an important part of your app marketing. When you include a video in your store listing, the feature graphic provides a link — indicated by an overlaid play icon — so the user can start watching it straight away.

## Benefits
Unlike the Apple App Store, Google Play offers more leeway to highlight and market apps. Feature graphics are a wonderful way to differentiate from competitors, so change the feature graphic often. For instance, a common trend now is to update app listings with themed designs for Valentine's Day, Halloween, Christmas, and other special occasions. Doing so conveys that apps are well-maintained and increases user confidence, as well as offers the chance to showcase pertinent benefits in a different way.

## Size
Google Play mandataes that feature graphics be 1024px x 500px.

## File Format
The Google Play Store accepts either JPEG or 24-bit PNG (no alpha) images.

## Placement
Feature graphics appear before the screenshots in an app listing on Google Play.

## Best Practices
* **Create Interest**

  Treat the feature graphic like a billboard ad on the highway. Assume users will only glance at the ad for a few seconds. The objective is to pique interest within this tiny window, to induce some browsing user to pause and explore the app listing further. The objective is not to explain the app in one graphic.
  
* **Complement Brand**

  Use colors, graphics, and language that complement your brand. For instance, if you include your app logo, pick colors for the feature graphic that complement your brand. If your app projects fun and youthfulness, use appropriate language in the copy. Ultiately, the design of the feature graphic should seamlessly blend in with your brand and app.
 
* **Grab with Visuals**

  Like billboard ads, the feature graphic should rely heavily on arresting graphics and colors to capture attention. Use text sparingly. Google web ads limit each line of copy to roughly 30-40 characters, and similar guidelines should apply to feature graphics. Grab user attention with visuals, not text. If possible, aim to restrict text to the app name and maybe a key phrase or two. When including text, remember to use font sizes large enough for text to remain legible across device sizes.

* **Localize**

  If you're targeting multiple countries, localize your feature graphic with the relevant languages so users can more easily understand your app.

* **Temporalize**

  Each new feature graphic offers a new way to attract users and highlight the benefits of your app. Change the feature graphic for special occasions like Christmas or Valentine's Day, or different promotions, events, or marketing campaigns linked to your company.
